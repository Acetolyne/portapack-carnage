**What is happening?**
Describe here why you are unable to upgrade the firmware. Before describing your problems, please read: https://github.com/eried/portapack-havoc/wiki/Update-firmware.

**Were you able to update the firmware before?**
Things might be confusing the first time, please check the video available on the link above if this is your first time.

**Can you try the upgrade with a different PC/Portapack/HackRF?**
If is possible, swap hardware and try again. Also, try different USB cables, even if the one you are using works fine for other purposes.
